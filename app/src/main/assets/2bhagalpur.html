<h3> Principal's Message  </h3>

On behalf of Bhagalpur College of Engineering Bhagalpur it is my pleasure to welcome you on the campus. This Institute has been known for its values for more than five decades and we strive hard to keep up the ethos. In case we have inadvertently slipped somewhere I offer my sincere apologies. It provides an optimum mix of theory and practical with strong bias on industrial applications. In more recent years introduction of modern infrastructure has further improved the programme.
