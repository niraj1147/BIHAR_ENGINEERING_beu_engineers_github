<h3> About Placement </h3>

Placements happen every year through campus interviews and job posting by the placement committee. Industry leaders visit our college for interview and selection of talented students into their companies. Placement Wing Placement is ok but at low scale and low salary like 3-4 lakh per annum which is too low. No college not provide internship. I have bad experience with college because college not make efforts because it is goverment funded so they hav eno fear of shut down etc Example TCS, DRDO, Crompton greaves etc. are some of the companies coming here

<h3> College Infrastructure </h3>
Since it was previously run into old IIT Patna campus. Now it has shifted into its own campus in Bakhtiyar pur. Since it is new, it is very neat and clean. All the required facilities available at here for the students. Negative remarks of the college is the society of outside the Institute is not good they are very poor mindset.
