<h3> College Infrastructure </h3>
There are not any good facility here, and the labs are also not available. Our college also doesn't have a mess and canteen, and I never saw medical facilities. Sports and games are also not available. So, whatever you want, you have to do on your own. There is not any better thing in this college.

It is humbling and inspiring to hear how generation after generation of engineers graduates have benefited from the academic excellence and practical expertise of this unique institution.
I am honoured to lead a team of wonderful faculty and administrators. Together, we help students learn, reflect and prepare to surmount every challenge created by a swiftly changing and highly competitive world. We do this by staying true to our roots while embracing the future.
